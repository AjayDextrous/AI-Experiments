# AI-Experiments
Basic Experiments with AI, primarily in PyTorch 

## 01_MNIST_Classifier
This exercise contains a basic number classifier on the MNIST Database. 
Initially a purely linear network is implemented, followed by a convolutional + FC layer network.

## 02_MNIST_Reconstruction
This exercise attempts to use an encoder-decoder setup to recreate input images.
